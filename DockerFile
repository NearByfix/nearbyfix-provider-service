# Step 1: Use official OpenJDK image for building
FROM eclipse-temurin:17-jdk AS build

# Set working directory inside container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy pom.xml and download dependencies (to leverage caching)
COPY pom.xml mvnw ./
COPY .mvn .mvn
RUN ./mvnw dependency:go-offline -B

# Copy source code and build the JAR
COPY src src
RUN ./mvnw clean package -DskipTests

# Step 2: Use a smaller JRE image for running
FROM eclipse-temurin:17-jre

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the built JAR from build stage
COPY --from=build /app/target/nearbyfix-provider-service.jar app.jar

# Expose application port (same as in application.properties, default 8080)
EXPOSE 8080

# Command to run the app
ENTRYPOINT ["java", "-jar", "app.jar"]
